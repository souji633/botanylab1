    Electron Micrographs of Cell Organelles
</p>
<p>
    AIM : To study the structure of a plant cell with the help of electron micrograph.</p>
<p>1. The Electron Micrograph of Mitochondria:</p>
<p>It is an electron micrograph of cell’s largest and most important organelle – the mitochondria and is characterized by the following features 
     The name mitochondria was given by Benda (1898) and their ma n function was brought to light by Kingsbury (1912).

(2) Each mitochondria in section appears as sausage or cup or bowl shaped structure lined by double membranes. Theoretically, the membrane is similar n structure and chemical composition to plasma membrane.</p>

(3) Two membranes are separated by a 6-8 mm wide fluid filled space called peri-mitochondrial space.

(4) The inner membrane is projected into the central cavity as finger like outgrowths- the cristae.

(5) Numerous small, rounded & stalked particles – The oxysomes or F1 or ATPare are attached to the inner surface of inner membrane.

(6) The central cavity is filled with matrix which theoretically possesses circular DNA 55s ribosomes and respiratory enzymes.

(7) The main function of mitochondria is to synthesize chemical energy- ATP from glucose as substrate.

(8) From one molecule of glucose 38 ATP molecules (40%) are synthesized and the rest of the energy (60%) goes as heat.</p>

</p>2. The Electron Micrograph of Golgi Complex:

It is the electron micrograph of Golgi complex along with its line drawing and is characterized by the following features </p>
,<img src="C:\Users\wahee\OneDrive\Desktop\image_thumb-427.png" width="200px" height="200px">   
<p>(1) It was discovered by Camillio Golgi (1898) and was named after his name.

(2) The Golgi complex, as is visible in electron microphotograph, is a stack (bundle) of hollow tubules, which in actual form are hollow flattened sacks arranged above each other. On either side certain large globular vesicles and smaller vacuoles are also visible.

(3) Each tubule or lamella is lined by membrane, which is theoretically similar to plasma membrane in structure and chemical composition.

ADVERTISEMENTS:


(4) The Golgi complex is more prominent and well developed in secretory cells and absent in RBC of mammals and prokaryotic cells.

(5) Its main function is to glycolise the proteins which are synthesized by ribosomes i.e., It converts these inert proteins into glycoprotein’s to act as hormones, enzymes and co­enzymes.

(6) It also helps in the formation of lysosomes and acrosome of sperms.</p>
