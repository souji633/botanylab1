    <P>Experiment - 1</p>
<p>AIM : To study the structure of a plant cell with the help of temporary mount of onion peel.</p>
<p>MATERIALS REQUIRED : Onion bulb, iodine solution, cover slip, forceps, razor, and needle.</p>
<p>PROCEDURE : Cut the onion first in half and then in quarter pieces lengthwise. Take one of the quarters and separate the fleshy leaves from the stem. Pull out the thin transparent layer from the concave or inner part of the fleshy leaves with the help of forceps. Put it on a watch glass containing water. Cut this peel into small square pieces. Add a drop of iodine to the watch glass containing onion peel. Select one piece and transfer it to the slide. Add a drop of glycerine to the peel and cover it with a cover slip. Observe the slide first under low power and then high power.
OBSERVATIONS : The cells of onion peel are rectangular in shape.Each cell is bounded by a distinct cell wall .
 A rounded deeply stained body is observed in every cell. This is called nucleus. There may be one or two large central vacuoles . The lightly stained substance toward periphery is called cuto plasam .</p>
