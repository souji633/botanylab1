<p><h3>1 MICROMETRY</h3></p>
Dr.H.B.Mahesha, Yuvaraja’s College, University of Mysore, Mysuru.
<p>Aim: To measure the size of microorganisms using micrometer.</p>
<p>Requirements: Ocular micrometer, stage micrometer, compound microscope and
specimen.</p>
<p>Introduction: Micrometry is the measurement of microscopic objects
(microorganisms). Since microorganism can be seen only under a microscope, a
suitable scale for their measurements should be somewhere in the microscope itself.
For this, an ocular micrometer (eye piece micrometer) and a stage micrometer is
used.
Ocular micrometer is simply a disc of glass upon which etched lines. There are
usually etched 100 equally spaced divisions, marked 0 to 100 upon an ocular
micrometer. However, the scale on the ocular micrometer does not have any
standard value.
Stage micrometer is simply a microscope glass slide having in its centre a known
(one millimeter) distance etched in to 100 equally spaced divisions. Thus each
division of the stage micrometer equals to 0.01 mm or 10 µm.</p>
<p>Principle: Ocular micrometer is calibrated under different objective lens systems of
the microscope by superimposing the graduations of stage micrometer. By
determining the how many divisions of ocular micrometer superimpose a known
distance on the stage micrometer, we may find out the exact value of one division of
ocular micrometer in the microscope field. Once calibrated, the ocular micrometer
can be used to measure the size of various microbes in terms of length, breadth and
diameter</p>.
<p>Procedure:
1. Replace the regular ocular lens with ocular eye piece lens with ocular
micrometer and observe. There will be seen scale lines of ocular micrometer
in sharp focus. This lines and distances will remain unchanged under different
objectives.
2. Mount the stage micrometer on the microscope stage and bring its scale in the
center of microscope field under a sharp focus. This is done first with lowpower objective and thereafter also with high-power objectives.
3. Adjust the scales of ocular micrometer and stage micrometer in such a way
that the lines of former superimpose upon those of the latter. If necessary the
ocular micrometer may be rotated or stage micrometer be moved on the
stage so that lines of ocular micrometer superimpose upon the stage
micrometer. The scales of both micrometers are to be adjusted in such a way
that the lines of the two coincide at one end of the microscope field. Now
count the spaces of each micrometer to a point where the lines of the two
micrometers coincide again. In this way we can find out how many divisions of
ocular micrometer (unknown scale) are equals to how many divisions of stage
micrometer (known scale).
4. Replace the stage micrometer with the slide bearing the microorganisms
whose measurements to be taken.</p>
