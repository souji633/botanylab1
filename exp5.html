Introduction
In the present study four species of the genus Blumea ,
namely Blumea fistulosa, Blumea lacera var.glandulosa
and Blumea laciniata from the asteraecea family collected
from Central Nepal was Cytologically carried out. The
genus Blumea is a flowering plants belonging to the family
Asteraceae. The plants of this genus Blumea are mostly
small weeds.Many species of this genus are used in
traditional Chinese medicine and also used in ornamental
plants. The genus Blumea locally called Kukur ghaans in

Nepal. Most of the species of Blumea are used in bodyache
(Kirtikar & Basu, 1987). Somatic chromosome number
determination and karyotypic analysis of the studied taxa
are the objective of this study.
Materials and Methods
The plants were collected from Central parts of Nepal,
brought to Kathmandu and transplanted in earthen pots at
my home garden. Somatic chromosomes were observed in
the meristamatic cells of root tips for karyotypic analysis.
To ensure full turgidity, plants were sufficiently watered for

two hours before the excision of the root tips for
pretreatment. Healthy root tips were pretreated in aqueous
solution of 0.002M 8-hydroxyquinoline for three hours.
They were then fixed in a mixture of absolute ethanol and
glacial acetic acid (3:1) for one day or more. In the
laboratory root tip materials were hydrolyzed and stained in
a mixture of 2% aceto-orcein and 1N HCl (9:1) contained
in watch glass and warmed for few seconds and left for 30
minutes to 1 hour. Squashes were made in 45% acetic acid.
The observations were done from this preparation to select
the plates for photomicrography. The drawings were made
at table level using opcolite-1366 Camera Lucida apparatus.
Photomicrographs were taken with the help of digital
camera of 12.1 megapixel using 10 x eye pieces and 100x
objective of trinocular compound microscope. The
methodology was followed according to Levan et al.
(1965).
Results and Discussion
Blumea fistulosa (Roxb.) Kurz (2n=22)
The plant is herb, annual, erect, 15-100 cm tall, shaggily
pubescent above. Leaves simple oblanceolate to obovate,
pubescent on both surfaces (Fig. 1), base narrowly long
attenuate, margin bidentate apex acute. Capitula in small
sessile clusters arranged in interrupted spike like terminal
racemes or sparsely branched panicles. Involucres 4- or 5-
seriate, phyllaries purplish adaxially. pubescent, sparsely
glandular, outer series lanceolate, remainder linear.
Receptacle sparsely shortly pubescent. Corollas yellow,
lobes of central florets with glandular and few glandular
hairs. Pappus white. Flowering period October to April.
Chromosome number determined for this taxon is 2n=22.
The somatic chromosome number determined from the root
tip cell is shown in (Fig. 1B) and camera lucida drawing in
(Fig. 1C) 3. Its ideogram is represented in (Fig.1D). The
chromosome measurements are given in Table 1,
The karyotype consists of two different types of
chromosomes with centromere at median point and submedian region. The chromosome length ranged from 0.6 to
1.6 µm with mean length 1.0 µm and absolute length 12.0
µmTF % is 45.0. Karyotype formul</p>
